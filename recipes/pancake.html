    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These are the best buttermilk pancakes. This recipe is handed down from my
      grandmother.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>3 cups buttermilk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>Â½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to
        manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl; mix
        thoroughly. Add 3 cups buttermilk, vegetable oil, and eggs; mix
        thoroughly by hand with a spoon. Add more buttermilk to adjust
        consistency if needed. Batter should be slightly lumpy but not too
        thick; pancakes will be flat if batter is overmixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, spoon batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until the
        bubbles that form on the top surface begin to pop, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip
        and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
